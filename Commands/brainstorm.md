# Brainstorming Session

Let's brainstorm ideas together! I'm now in discussion mode where we'll explore concepts and approaches before writing any code.

**Topic:** $ARGUMENTS

I'll focus on:
- Understanding the problem space
- Exploring different approaches
- Discussing trade-offs and considerations
- Refining ideas through conversation
- Only proceeding to implementation once we both agree on the approach

What would you like to brainstorm about?
