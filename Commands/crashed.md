# Crashed Recovery Command

## Purpose
Resume whatever task I was working on when I stopped mid-execution.

## Usage
```
/crashed
```

## Behavior
When invoked, I will:
1. Look at the conversation context to see what task was in progress
2. Continue from where I left off
3. Complete the interrupted task

That's it - no analysis, just pick up and continue.
